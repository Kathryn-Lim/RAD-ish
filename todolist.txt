-Ground
	-Generate ground while player moves //DONE, i just generated 1000 ground in advance, can last player for ~1 hour
	

-obstacles
	-create obstacles for the game	//DONE, but using vectors, if collision is applied, animation cannot be applied vice versa
	-apply collision logic on the obstacle	//DONE
	-apply texture to the obstacle		//DONE
	-generate obstacles along with the ground	//DONE, Generated 900 of them in advance
	

-player
	-make player constantly move to the right	//Done, for debug purposes still controlled using keys
	-create function that when user presses spacebar, player jumps //DONE

-gameplay	
	-Increase speed of the player after a set amount of time. (means increases the diffculty) //DONE (player speeds up every 7 seconds)

	-implement every second counts as +1 score. (Clock.h)?
	use a clock timer to keep time elapsed	:
	  sf::Clock clk;
	  sf::Time elapsed = clk.getElapsedTime();
	  std::cout << elapsed.asSeconds() << std::endl;
	  (time will come out as a float (1.0000))

	-function for scoring system (always displayed on screen)
	-apply texture to background of the game [OPTIONAL]
	-background music for the game //DONE
	-use collision to make game stop when player hits obstacle	//DONE

-UI
	-Display GAME OVER Text when game is stopped and player collides with obstacle
	-implement restart button on screen (or "press enter to restart") to loop playGame()
	-when player hits the obstacle, give players option to restart
	-display text/graphics onto the game window to state "Press Spacebar to Jump"
